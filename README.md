**The Problem**

If a student wishes to find out about a CCA's upcoming events, he has to visit the [official CCA directory page](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/CampusLife/Clubs/pages/clubssocieties.aspx) first, before entering the CCA's website. This is a time-consuming process which severely limits student awareness and participation.

**Solution**

By aggregating all CCA events in one site, NTUEvents serves as a convenient platform for students to get the latest updates on upcoming activities. In turn, CCAs can reach a wider student audience.

**Technical Information**

Programming languages used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

To display the views, we use Vue.Js as our front-end framework.

To set up our api backend, we use Nodejs with express
